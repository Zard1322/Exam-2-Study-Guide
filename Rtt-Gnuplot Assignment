# Bash script that performs the following task:
# Create a file called “rtt.txt”
# Finds the RTT from all the AWS regions across North America and puts the output in rtt.txt
# Uses GNUPlot to plot this data and save the output in a file

# Create a file called “rtt.txt”
touch rtt.txt

# Define the North American AWS regions
regions=(“us-east-1” “us-east-2” “us-west-1” “us-west-2” “ca-central-1”)

# Use a for loop to go through different regions, get RTT, and put the output in “rtt.txt”
for region in “${regions[@]}”
do
	rtt=$(ping -c 10 ec2.$region.amazonaws.com | awk -F ‘/’ ‘/rtt/ {print $5}’)
	echo “$region $rtt” >> rtt.txt

# Download WinSCP (DOWNLOAD LINK	https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
# SSH into the AWS EC2 Instance on login (Hit advanced, hit SSH, and use the same credentials and .ppk destination you use to SSH from putty)
# Afterwards, click and drag the created image from the instance over to the local system
# The instance file system should be on the right and your local file system should be on the left.
